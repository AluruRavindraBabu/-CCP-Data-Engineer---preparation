Sample Exam Question

LoudAcre Mobile is a mobile phone service provider that is moving a portion of their customer analytics workload to Hadoop. Before they can use their customer data, they want you to clean it and make it consistent.

Errors were found while looking at the customer records. Unfortunately, different input methods wrote date fields in different formats.  Your task is to standardize these date fields into a consistent format.

Data Description

The Hive metastore contains a database named problem1 that contains a table named customer. The customer table contains 90 million customer records (90,000,000), each with a birthday field.

Sample data (birthday is in bold)

96391595,Thomas Stewart,6/17/1969
2236067,John Nelson,08/22/54
Output Requirements

Create a new table named solution in the problem1 database of the Hive metastore
Your solution table must have its data stored in the HDFS directory /user/cert/problem1/solution
Your solution table must have exactly the same columns as the customer table in the same order, as well as keeping the existing file format
For every row in the solution table, replace the contents of the birthday field with a date string in “MM/DD/YY” format.

MM is the zero-padded month (01-12),
DD is the zero-padded day (01-31),
YY is the zero-padded 2-digit year (00-99)
