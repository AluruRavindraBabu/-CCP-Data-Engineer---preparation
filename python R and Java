Summary, Tips, Hints  -- From Coursera
If you had trouble with any of the pre-install steps, and this document does not help, please ask over on the discussion group.

Remember to fetch and install Java 8, not Java 9.

Remember to get 64-bit versions of everything. (32-bit will work, but you will only have 2GB, which will restrict the size of data sets you can work on, and how many models you can keep in H2O at one time.)

Linux Commands
These were the Linux commands shown (for Ubuntu 16):

# For Java8

sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

# For R

sudo apt install r-base libcurl4-openssl-dev

# For RStudio (change the * to match the deb file you downloaded)

# To test RStudio look for it in the menus.

sudo apt install libjpeg62

sudo dpkg -i rstudio-*-amd64.deb

# For Python, pip and Jupyter

sudo apt install python3-pip

pip3 install jupyter

# To test Jupyter

jupyter-notebook

Windows
Remember to get Java 8, not Java 9, and a 64-bit version.

When installing each file the defaults were accepted except:

In the Java install I checked the checkbox to update the path
In R I told it not to bother installing 32-bit versions
To start Jupyter, open a terminal and type:

jupyter-notebook

More Python Packages
You could take this opportunity to install some other packages that will come in useful:

#Java 11 Installation

Install Oracle JDKPermalink

The Linux Uprising Oracle Java PPA uses packages that include install scripts to install the Oracle JDK.

#Update your system:

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

#Check that SHA256 checksum of the binary you downloaded matches the checksum:

#cd Downloads/
    sha256sum jdk-11.0.5_linux-x64*

#Create a /var/cache/oracle-jdk11-installer-local/ folder, and copy the Oracle JDK 11 .tar.gz from Downloads folder to this folder.

    sudo mkdir -p /var/cache/oracle-jdk11-installer-local/
    sudo cp jdk-11.0.5_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz /var/cache/oracle-jdk11-installer-local/

#Add the PPA to Ubuntu. Apt will automatically refresh the package cache.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
    sudo apt-get update

#Install the oracle JDK.

    sudo apt install oracle-java11-installer-local

    If you want Oracle JDK as the system default, install oracle-java11-set-default-local:

    sudo apt install oracle-java11-set-default-local

    Check that the install was successful with the following command:

    java --version

      
    root@ubuntu:~# java --version
    java version "11.0.5" 2019-10-15 LTS
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.5+10-LTS)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.5+10-LTS, mixed mode)

    Reload /etc/profile or log out of your system and back in to set the Java environment variables:

    source /etc/profile

      
    root@ubuntu:~# echo $JAVA_HOME
    /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-oracle
