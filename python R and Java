Summary, Tips, Hints  -- From Coursera
If you had trouble with any of the pre-install steps, and this document does not help, please ask over on the discussion group.

Remember to fetch and install Java 8, not Java 9.

Remember to get 64-bit versions of everything. (32-bit will work, but you will only have 2GB, which will restrict the size of data sets you can work on, and how many models you can keep in H2O at one time.)

Linux Commands
These were the Linux commands shown (for Ubuntu 16):

# For Java8

sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

# For R

sudo apt install r-base libcurl4-openssl-dev

# For RStudio (change the * to match the deb file you downloaded)

# To test RStudio look for it in the menus.

sudo apt install libjpeg62

sudo dpkg -i rstudio-*-amd64.deb

# For Python, pip and Jupyter

sudo apt install python3-pip

pip3 install jupyter

# To test Jupyter

jupyter-notebook

Windows
Remember to get Java 8, not Java 9, and a 64-bit version.

When installing each file the defaults were accepted except:

In the Java install I checked the checkbox to update the path
In R I told it not to bother installing 32-bit versions
To start Jupyter, open a terminal and type:

jupyter-notebook

More Python Packages
You could take this opportunity to install some other packages that will come in useful:

(Remember to use "pip3" instead of "pip" on some versions of Linux, where both Python 2 and Python 3 are installed.)
